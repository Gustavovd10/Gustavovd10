### Hi there I'm Gustavo V. Dantas, 

  I'm Gustavo V. Dantas, I have always been able to relate to people and create good relationships, one of my strengths is the ease of interpersonal relationships. Because of this, I tried to improve my communication and looked for other ways to connect. So I graduated in International Relations.
  As a result of this search, I worked as a volunteer at the NGO, AIESEC, as the exchange sales team leader.
I studied French for 6 months in Montreal, Canada, and came back desiring for knowledge. In 2020, I took on the role of international policy columnist at Brado magazine, through the Medium platform for a year and started to venture into various niches such as freelance translation jobs in PT-BR/EN/FR.
  In 2022, watching videos on the internet of people creating websites with amazing features, I started to get interested in HTML and CSS. Because of that I started taking free courses on Youtube like "SuperSimpleDev - Beginner to Pro", which in a simple and didactic way made me even more motivated to learn.
  In August I bought the course "Ser Front End" on the Udemy platform and promptly started my career transition. Today I'm looking for my first professional experience to start my career as a Front end developer
